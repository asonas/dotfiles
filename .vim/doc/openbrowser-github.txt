INTRODUCTION						*github-introduction* {{{

## About

Opens GitHub URL of current file, etc. from Vim.
Also supports GitHub Enterprise.

## Install

Since this plugin depends on open-browser.vim(https://github.com/tyru/open-browser.vim), you will need to install open-browser.vim first.

## Usage

There are 3 commands.

### :OpenGithubFile

Opens a specific file in github.com repository(it also opens in the current branch by default).
>
	" Opens current files URL in github.com
	:OpenGithubFile
	" Opens current files highlighted place in github.com 
	:'<,'>OpenGithubFile
	" Opens a specific file in github.com
	:OpenGithubFile PATH/TO/FILE
<

### :OpenGithubIssue

Opens a specific Issue.
>
	" Opens current repositories Issue #1
	:OpenGithubIssue 1
	" Opens a specific repositories Issue #1
	:OpenGithubIssue 1 tyru/open-browser.vim
<
The third command is |:OpenGithubPullReq|, but it basically does the same thing as |:OpenGithubIssue| since GitHub redirects '/issues/1' to '/pull/1' if #1 is a Pull Request.

## GitHub Enterprise setting

Like the hub command(https://github.com/defunkt/hub), by setting 'hub.host', you can open a GitHub Enterprise repository page.

You can set 'hub.host' by executing the command below. Make sure you execute it in the git repository.
>
	$ git config --local hub.host my.git.org
<
